# Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) Response

## Establishing Incident Command (IC)

* First arriving responder assumes Incident Commander (IC) role until relieved by a higher authority.
* Size up the scene: Assess hazards, number of casualties, type of incident.
* Establish a command post (CP): Identify a safe and central location.
* Implement Incident Command System (ICS): Assign key roles as resources arrive.
* Request additional resources: Fire, EMS, law enforcement, public health, etc.
* Activate triage and treatment areas: Ensure coordination with hospitals.

## MCI Management Process

### Phase 1: Initial Response
1.	First Responder Size-Up:
	* Assess safety, number of victims, and hazards.
	* Assume Incident Command and establish command post.
2.	Activate ICS & Request Resources:
	* Assign ICS positions as help arrives.
	* Request additional fire, EMS, police, mutual aid.
3.	Initiate Triage:
	* Use START or JumpSTART for pediatric cases.
	* Categorize patients (Immediate, Delayed, Minor, Deceased).
	* JumpSTART Triage Process for pediatrics:
4.	Establish Treatment & Transport Areas:
	* Designate separate zones for each triage category.
	* Prepare for mass patient movement.

### Phase 2: Operations & Patient Management
5.	Deploy Tactical Teams:
	* Extrication teams remove trapped victims.
	* EMS treats and stabilizes.
6.	Transport Coordination:
	* Assign patients to appropriate hospitals based on severity.
	* Maintain communication with hospitals.
7.	Scene Security & Traffic Control:
	* Law enforcement ensures orderly access.

### Phase 3: Sustained Operations & Demobilization
8.	Ongoing Patient Management:
	* Ensure all casualties receive appropriate care.
	* Reassess triage and stabilize worsening cases.
9.	Resource Management:
	* Continue monitoring supplies and personnel needs.
10.	Demobilization & After-Action Review:
	* Gradually scale down response operations.
	* Conduct a debriefing for improvement planning.

## Triage Categories and Decision Trees

### Triage Categories

| Category | Color | Criteria |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Immediate | Red | Life-threatening injuries requiring rapid treatment (e.g., severe bleeding, airway obstruction, unconscious but breathing) |
| Delayed | Yellow | Serious but not immediately life-threatening injuries (e.g., fractures, moderate burns, conscious but unable to move) |
| Minor | Green | Walking wounded with minor injuries (e.g., small cuts, sprains, minor burns) |
| Deceased | Black | No breathing after airway opened, no pulse, no response to rescue breaths (pediatrics) |

### Adults - START Decision Tree

#### Steps:

1.	Assess ability to walk
  * Walking → MINOR (Green)
  * Not walking → Move to step 2
2.	Check Respirations
  * No breathing → Open airway
  * Starts breathing → IMMEDIATE (Red)
  * Still not breathing → DECEASED (Black)
  * Breathing rate > 30/min → IMMEDIATE (Red)
  * Breathing rate ≤ 30/min → Move to step 3
3.	Check Perfusion (Capillary Refill)
  * No radial pulse or cap refill > 2 sec → IMMEDIATE (Red)
  * Pulse present & cap refill ≤ 2 sec → Move to step 4
4.	Check Mental Status
  * Unconscious or unable to follow commands → IMMEDIATE (Red)
  * Follows commands → DELAYED (Yellow)

#### Decision Tree

```
1. Can they walk?  
   ├── YES → MINOR (Green)  
   └── NO  
        ↓  
2. Are they breathing?  
   ├── NO → Open airway  
   │   ├── Breathing starts → IMMEDIATE (Red)  
   │   ├── Still not breathing → DECEASED (Black)  
   ├── YES  
   │   ├── Respiratory rate >30? → IMMEDIATE (Red)  
   │   ├── Respiratory rate ≤30 → Continue  
   │  
3. Do they have radial pulse? (Cap refill ≤2 sec?)  
   ├── NO → IMMEDIATE (Red)  
   ├── YES → Continue  
   │  
4. Can they follow simple commands?  
   ├── NO → IMMEDIATE (Red)  
   ├── YES → DELAYED (Yellow)
```

### Pediatrics - JumpSTART Decision Tree

#### Steps

Steps:
1.	Assess ability to walk
  * Walking → MINOR (Green)
  * Not walking → Move to step 2
2.	Check Breathing
  * Not breathing → Open airway
  * Spontaneous breathing → IMMEDIATE (Red)
  * Still not breathing → Check for pulse
  * Pulse present → Give 5 rescue breaths
  * Breathing resumes → IMMEDIATE (Red)
  * Still not breathing → DECEASED (Black)
  * No pulse → DECEASED (Black)
  * Breathing rate <15 or >45/min → IMMEDIATE (Red)
  * Breathing rate 15-45/min → Move to step 3
3.	Check Perfusion
  * No palpable pulse → IMMEDIATE (Red)
  * Pulse present → Move to step 4
4.	Check Mental Status
  * Inappropriate response (e.g., posturing, unresponsive) → IMMEDIATE (Red)
  * Appropriate but unable to walk → DELAYED (Yellow)

#### Decision Tree
```
1. Can they walk?  
   ├── YES → MINOR (Green)  
   └── NO  
        ↓  
2. Are they breathing?  
   ├── NO → Open airway  
   │   ├── Breathing starts → IMMEDIATE (Red)  
   │   ├── Still not breathing → Check for pulse  
   │       ├── Pulse present → 5 rescue breaths  
   │       │     ├── Breathing resumes → IMMEDIATE (Red)  
   │       │     ├── Still not breathing → DECEASED (Black)  
   │       ├── No pulse → DECEASED (Black)  
   ├── YES  
   │   ├── Breathing rate <15 or >45? → IMMEDIATE (Red)  
   │   ├── Breathing rate 15-45 → Continue  
   │  
3. Do they have a pulse?  
   ├── NO → IMMEDIATE (Red)  
   ├── YES → Continue  
   │  
4. Are they responding appropriately?  
   ├── NO (unresponsive, posturing) → IMMEDIATE (Red)  
   ├── YES (alert but unable to walk) → DELAYED (Yellow)  
```
